			<h2>The World of Lifeway</h2>
			<p>At Lifeway Foods, we are on a mission. A mission that started in 1986 when we first began producing Lifeway Kefir.</p>
			<p>Like all good missions, ours is simply expressed: We’re here to provide the best in probiotic and nutritious foods. We’re here to improve the health of our customers.  And we’re here to leave the world a better place than we found it.</p>
			<p>On a lighter note, we’re also here to change the meaning of the word delicious, and to have a little fun along the way. You with us? Good. Very good.</p>

			<h2 class="text-gold">THE LIFEWAY STORY</h2>
			<h4 class="text-gold">FROM THE BASEMENT TO NASDAQ</h4>
			<p>The Lifeway story begins in 1986, when Russian immigrant Michael Smolyansky began making Kefir in the basement of his Skokie, IL home. The cultured dairy drink had been popular in Eastern Europe for centuries, but Smolyansky was determined to share his delicious health secret with his newfound home. Two years later, Michael took the company public and it debuted on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol LWAY.</p>

			<p>Since its humble basement beginnings many years ago, Lifeway Foods has now grown into the largest manufacturer of Kefir in the United States and has brought the delicious taste and probiotic health benefits of Kefir to a whole new generation.</p>

			<h2 class="text-gold">LIFEWAY IS #1</h2>
			<p>In 2011, Julie and Ed commemorated Lifeway’s 25th Anniversary by ringing the NASDAQ bell. A lot has changed since 1986. Lifeway has acquired top competitors Helios Nutrition (in 2006) and Fresh Made Dairy (in 2009), giving them the #1 market share in probiotic dairy products.</p>
			<p>Lifeway has also innovated several new ideas in the dairy industry by introducing breakthrough products such as ProBugs kefir for kids, BioKefir™, and Frozen Kefir. Lifeway has even gone as far as founding The Lifeway Kefir Shop, a delicious chain of frozen kefir cafés in the Chicago area.</p>
			<p>Though many things have changed since 1986, our commitment to producing the highest quality cultured foods remains the same. After more than a quarter-century of dedication and innovation, the Lifeway family looks forward to building on our tradition of healthy and delicious living for many years to come.</p>
